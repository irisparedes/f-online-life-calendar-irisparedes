This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Created by Iris Paredes.
Technical test 3. Adalab 2019.

### `Summary`
It is a calendar in which every day you are aiming how the day has gone by choosing a smiley. The idea is to be able to see a period of time in context so that bad days can not be good.

### `Specifications`
There are only two options, good day or bad day: :) รณ :(
In the case of a good day, :), you can add a message
Once saved a day can no longer be edited
This time it is not necessary to manage the gaps (if I leave X days without adding)
Navigation:
There are two views, the edit view and the list view
The editor is accessed with the + button that appears fixed at the top of the screen
The save / cancel buttons return to list view
The data will be saved in the browser's storage location;)
